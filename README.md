# Tax-Transparency-Framework

### *Tax Transparency Framework* is a comprehensive framework that defines the core principles and guidelines for building a *Transparent Tax Collection System*, along with its supporting components. The framework focuses on leveraging technology to ensure transparency for both taxpayers and tax authorities. 

### The primary goal of this framework is to create a system where taxpayers can verify, *in real-time*, that their payments are accurately recorded and received by the government. This ensures full accountability, transparency, and trust in the entire tax process, providing both taxpayers and tax authorities with immediate access to reliable and up-to-date information.
